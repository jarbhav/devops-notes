# `Escaping`
BACKSLASH ESCAPES
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word with literal asterisks you can use backslashes before the asterisks, like this:

```md
\*literal asterisks\*
```

\*literal asterisks\*

# `Mentioning people and teams`
You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing `@` plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see "About notifications."

Note: A person will only be notified about a mention if the person has read access to the repository and, if the repository is owned by an organization, the person is a member of the organization.

# `Referencing issues and pull requests`
You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing` #`. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.
